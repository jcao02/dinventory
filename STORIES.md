## Roadmap
1. As an anonymous user, I can sign-in using a web3 provider so I can use the app.
2. As a user, I'm able to create a new inventory with its name and description, so I can keep track of the items I'm storing.
3. As a user, I'm able to edit an existing inventory's name and description, so I can fix any typos or just change them.
4. As a user, I'm able to see an inventory current state which includes the item code, concept quantity and location, so I can check the item's existence.
5. As a user, I'm able to see a list of my inventories so I can choose one of them to see more details.
6. As a user, I'm able to remove an inventory, to stop tracking all items in it.
7. As a user, I'm able to create a new item and add it to the inventory's item catalog with the item SKU and concept, so I can use it later in the inventory.
8. As a user, I'm able to remove an item from the inventory's item catalog, so it's not longer used in the inventory.

10. As a user, I'm able to remove a phyical space from the inventory's storage system, so it's no longer used to store any item.
11. As a user, I'm able to add a new item from the item's catalog to the inventory specifying its physical location, so I can keep track of that item.
12. As a user, I'm able to remove an item from an inventory's physical location, so I can consume it or just stop tracking it.
13. As a user, I'm able to borrow an item from the inventory, so I can use it to later return it.
14. As a user, I'm able to return a borrowed item to the inventory specifying the physical location, so it's stored again.
